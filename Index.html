            <h2>About Atal Ji</h2>
            <p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee (25 December 1924 – 16 August 2018) was an Indian politician and poet who served three terms as the 10th Prime Minister of India, first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months from 1998 to 1999, followed by a full term from 1999 to 2004. 
                He was the first non-Congress prime minister to serve a full term in the office.
                He was a member of the RSS, a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation.
                He was among the founding members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, of which he was president from 1968 to 1972. 
                The BJS merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party, which won the 1977 general election. 
                In March 1977, Vajpayee became the Minister of External Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister, Morarji Desai. 
                Former members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh formed the Bharatiya Janata Party in 1980, with Vajpayee its first president.
                During his tenure as prime minister, India carried out the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. 
                After the 1999 Kargil War with Pakistan, he sought to restore relations through engagement with President Pervez Musharraf, inviting him to India for a summit at Agra. 
                The administration of Narendra Modi declared in 2014 that Vajpayee's birthday, 25 December, would be marked as Good Governance Day. In 2015, he was conferred India's highest civilian honour — Bharat Ratna, by the then-President of India, Pranab Mukherjee. He died in 2018 of age-related illness..</p>
